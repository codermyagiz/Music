## What is Music Project?

This project attempts to make your own music, albeit partially. 

The working logic of the project is actually asking you some questions and with **.format** method, it fills in the gaps and recreates the song according to your properties.

## Libraries
Music Project uses 2 libraries. The first of these is the [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time) library. The second is the [Winsound](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html) library. These are Python's default libraries.
