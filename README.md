## What is Music Project?

This project attempts to make your own music, albeit partially. 

The working logic of the project is actually asking you some questions and with **.format** method, it fills in the gaps and recreates the song according to your properties.

## Libraries
Music Project uses 2 libraries. The first of these is the [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time) library. The second is the [Winsound](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html) library. These are Python's default libraries.


## İnstallation 
### Setting up your PC
1.  If you don't already have Python,  [download Python 3.6 from this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/)
*That's all.*
### **Using command line**
Open a new  [command line window](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm). This is called 'Terminal' on a Mac, 'Command Prompt' on Windows, and 'shell' or 'terminal' on Linux. Type the following:
`git clone https://github.com/codermyagiz/Music`

Navigate to the Music folder in your command line window using the  ['cd' command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command))  - you may need to change the path, depending on how you've configured git on your computer:

`cd Music`

Next, install the required modules:

`pip install -U -q -r requirements.txt`
